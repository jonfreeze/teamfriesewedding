		<h3>Our Story</h3>
			<p>
			Basically, this was meant to happen. John and Rachel's parents belonged to a support group called L.A.P.A (Latin American Parent's Association). The group was focused on getting parents together who adopted children from Latin American countries. John and Rachel met at around 15yrs old, they knew of each other, but never because close friends. Years went by (about 20yrs), they reconnected through a mutual friend on Facebook and from there the rest is history. Both of them being adopted made a huge impact on who they are now and why they can relate on another level. As said in the begining, this was meant to happen.

<!-- The Proposal -->
<div id="proposal" class="row info">

		<h3>The Proposal</h3>
			<p>
			Being as it is New York City, there were many places for John to make a huge display of his love for the one and only Rachel Graff. After consulting with one of his closest friends, he put his proposal together in a matter of days.
			</p>
			<p>Rachel was headed out of town for what was supposed to be 3 days for work which later turned into a week and actually worked to John's advantage. He was able to purchase the ring and have it shipped in time for his proposal.</p>

			<p>John had planned on having the ring shipped to his friend's apt in the upper east side of Manhattan, but after a call from his shipper, it was actually on its way to Brooklyn. So he was able to intercept the package and pick it up at the shipping center. From there he waited that whole week for her return. (It was rough!)</p>

			<p>John loves sharing his dreams with Rachel, espeically when they are memorable. So when Rachel returned, he did just that. He woke up and sort of waited/nudged Rachel to wake up. He share his nightmare about how he got her a ring and it got shipped to the wrong address when it was supposed to go to Manhattan. She thought nothing of it because he always shares his dreams. After telling her about his dream, he slowly got up and went in his closet where the ring was stashed, Rachel was busy petting our cat. John hopped back in bed and presented her with the ring and said this wasn't a nightmare, but a real story. From there he asked her to marry him.</p>

			<p>It was June 14, 2014 and the sun was out, 80 &deg; and the day was just amazing. If there was anyway to celebrate an engagement, that was the day.</p>

		<h3>Registry</h3>	
			<p>
			Since we have a full apartment with probably too much furniture and silverwear, we are asking people to donate money so we can save up for a Brownstone to buy in Brooklyn one day. We decided to skip all the normal registry items since we pretty much have that covered. Other gifts are totally welcome, of course. This is just something set for anyone who may have no clue what to get. Head on over to this site for more information.
